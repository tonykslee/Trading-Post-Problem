# Trading-Post-Problem

This class creates a grid of random numbers in the form of a triangle
that represent costs from moving from number to number.  The program then
finds the shortest path from the first "trading post" to the N "trading post".
To find the solution, the program will use the Brute Force Algorithm, 
Dynamic Programming Algorithm, and the Divide and Conquer Algorithm.
